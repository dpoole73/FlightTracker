- Idle conditions was bouncing too fast

### Fixed

## [v2.2.1] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed
- **Map longitude wrapping bug** - the Leaflet maps in settings allowed zooming out to see multiple Earth copies. Clicking on a repeated copy could produce longitudes > 180 or < -180, which were stored verbatim. Fixed with three layers of defence:
  - `worldCopyJump: true` on both maps so Leaflet snaps click coordinates to the primary world copy
  - `maxBounds` + `maxBoundsViscosity` to prevent panning/zooming beyond a single Earth
  - `noWrap: true` on tile layers to stop repeated tile rendering
  - `wrapLng()` normalisation on every click, drag, double-click, and manual input handler in settings.js
- **Config longitude normalisation on load** - `Config.load()` now wraps all stored longitude fields (`flight_lng`, `flight_observer_lng`, `flight_zone_tl_x`, `flight_zone_br_x`) to [-180, 180) on startup, automatically fixing any bad data from the map bug
- **Form submission longitude normalisation** - `parse_settings_form()` in `web/app.py` now wraps longitudes before saving, as a backend safety net

## [v2.2.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- **Idle theme system** - the idle screen is now themeable, with a pluggable architecture making it easy to introduce new idle themes
- **Conditions idle theme** - new theme showing current weather conditions with animated weather sprites, wind direction, sunrise/sunset times, moon phase, and temperature
- **Forecast idle theme** - new theme displaying the weather forecast with min/max temperature colouring, sun rays, moon phase icons, and bouncy text descriptions
- **Classic idle theme** - the previous idle screen layout, preserved as a selectable theme
- **Animated weather sprites** - a sprite-based animation engine with animations for rain, snow, blowing snow, fog, mist, dust, sleet, thunder, moon rays, and sun rays, mapped to weather codes from all supported data sources
- **Moon phase display** - moon phase calculation with custom-drawn icons (new, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full, waning gibbous, last quarter, waning crescent)
- **Wind direction icons** - compass direction icons (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) for weather display
- **Sunrise/sunset icons** - dedicated sunrise and sunset icons in the conditions theme
- **Sun times utility** - new `sun_times.py` module for sunrise/sunset lookups, cached locally as they are queried frequently
- **FR24 fallback for route lookups** - when hexdb.io returns no origin/destination for a callsign, the lookup now falls back to FlightRadar24, improving route coverage while keeping FR24 usage minimal (only on hexdb misses)
- **Release notes inline on update page** - the web UI update page now fetches and displays release notes from GitHub directly, with a lightweight markdown renderer
- **Theme selection in web UI** - theme picker added to settings, with a warning when selecting a new theme
- **Optional mist effect** - mist animation can be toggled off
- **Optional blinker** - the loading blinker LED is now optional (configurable)
- 26 new route lookup tests covering hexdb success/failure, FR24 fallback, and the public `get_route` interface
- New test suites for animations (290 tests), weather codes (113 tests), forecast (129 tests), and forecast sprites (182 tests)

### Changed
- **Idle scene refactored** - the monolithic idle scene has been split into a theme system under `scenes/idle/themes/`, with shared utilities in `theme_utilities.py`
- **Weather data expanded** - the conditions theme pulls in more weather data including wind direction and current conditions
- **Forecast trimmed to future-only** - forecast data is now trimmed to only include future time periods
- **Time display customised** - time font size bumped up and given more character in the idle themes
- **Temperature-based colour** - forecast min/max temperatures now drive the colour of the display text
- **Theme-aware loading blinker** - the blinker position now adjusts based on the active theme
- **Airport name fixes** - airport display names corrected; having no blinker is now an option
- **de421.bsp** - added to `.gitignore` and removed from git tracking
- **Animation engine rewritten** - the animation engine was rewritten for the new sprite-based system

### Fixed
- **Frame stall on TLE fetch** - `SatelliteScene.poll()` was blocking for 5 seconds when Celestrak was down because `recompute_passes()` called `tle_manager.get(timeout=5.0)`. Added a non-blocking `try_get()` variant to `TLEManager` so the display loop is no longer stalled
- **Celestrak failures no longer slow everything down** - TLE lookup failures are now handled gracefully with back-off
- **TLE lookup back-off** - added back-off logic to prevent hammering Celestrak on repeated failures
- **None guard** - added guard against `None` values in theme display
- **File handle leak** - file now properly closed after use in moon phase calculation
- **Update save error message** - improved error message when saving settings fails

### Removed
- **Astro theme** - the astronomy-themed idle screen has been removed (superseded by the new theme system)

## [v2.1.7] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Simulator draws text at correct location now
- Scheduled brightness at 0 should be proper dark now

### Added
- Can override airport info when generating airport cache json
- When brightness is 0 at scheduled hours we no longer poll data sources
- Things for GitHub (PR template, etc)
- Proper info about the PWM generation enabled option


## [v2.1.6] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Scroller has came down one pixel to avoid parenthesis bug

## [v2.1.5] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- Classic (v1) theme that mimics the original FlightTracker look

### Changed
- Font tweaks: aligned 0s and s characters to fit font widths
- Adjusted .service template for easier default Pi user installation

## [v2.1.4] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Loading screen tests to ensure data sources are working
- Moved to hexdb.io for flight lookups
- Can delete cache from web UI

### Fixed
- Logic around when to jog onto the next flight's details have been tweaked

## [v2.1.3] - 2026-07-12

### Changed
- Settings UI refactored: categories now split into separate pages using Vue Router (hash mode), with a persistent sidebar and a Save button always visible at the bottom.
- All CSS across the web templates consolidated into a shared `style.css` file.
- All settings page JavaScript extracted into a dedicated `settings.js` file.

## [v2.1.2] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- OSN now polls at maximum rate the free API will allow

## [v2.1.1] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Minor UI updates for the data-sources network.

### Fixed
- Cache is now cleared on update so stale entries never survive a version change.

## [v2.1.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **OpenSky Network data source** - use OSN as an alternative to FlightRadar24, authenticated via OAuth2 client credentials (Client ID + Client Secret obtained from your OSN account). Configured from the web UI under Data Source.
- **adsbdb.com unified lookup** - route origin/destination and aircraft type are now both resolved via [adsbdb.com](https://api.adsbdb.com) for tar1090 and OpenSky Network data sources, replacing the previous mix of adsb.im (routes) and hexdb.io (aircraft type). Route and aircraft lookups are now independent, each cached under their own key with a 24-hour TTL.
- `python flight-tracker.py cache clear` CLI command to wipe all on-disk cache files (routes and TLE).
- Cache is automatically cleared on a successful OTA update so stale entries never survive a version change.

### Changed
- `data_source` config key now accepts `"osn"` in addition to `"fr24"` and `"tar1090"`.
- `route_lookup.py` rewritten to use two separate adsbdb endpoints (`/v0/callsign/{callsign}` for routes, `/v0/aircraft/{mode_s}` for aircraft type) rather than the combined endpoint, which silently omitted route data when adsbdb could not verify the callsign-airframe association.
- Stale cache entries with empty origin and destination are now treated as cache misses and re-queried, fixing cases where old backend data blocked fresh lookups.

### Fixed
- Origin and destination showing blank for flights whose routes were known to adsbdb via the callsign endpoint but not resolvable via the combined aircraft endpoint (e.g. KLM933 -> AMS-DUB).
- Python 3.13 dummy-thread GC noise (`TypeError: 'NoneType' object does not support the context manager protocol`) eliminated by using persistent `requests.Session` objects in `route_lookup`, `overhead_tar1090`, and `overhead_osn`.

## [v2.0.7] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Pytest test suite with 141 tests across 8 modules covering configuration migration, route caching, flight scene helpers, overhead data handling, CLI dispatch, satellite math, scene manager, and theme system
- `pyproject.toml` now includes `dev` optional dependencies (`pytest`, `pytest-cov`) and `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` configuration
- CI workflow expanded with a `test` job that installs dependencies and runs the full pytest suite
- GitHub issue templates (bug report with debug config export guidance, feature request linking to CONTRIBUTING.md)
- `SECURITY.md` with responsible disclosure guidance
- Ko-fi funding link in `.github/FUNDING.yml` and floating button on the gh-pages site
- `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format, covering v2.0.0 onward)

### Fixed
- Plane cache retrieval bugs where flights were not pulling out of cache correctly
- README license link corrected from `LICENSE` to `LICENSE.md`
- Ruff lint issues (42 auto-fixed, 11 manually fixed) across the codebase

### Changed
- LICENSE copyright year updated to 2026
- `.gitignore` updated with `node_modules/`, `_site/`, `.dev/`

## [v2.0.6] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Airport display options expanded from a simple full-name toggle to five styles: short code, full name, abbreviated name, municipality, and municipality + country
- Replaced `full_airport_name` and `abbreviate_name` config keys with a single `airport_display_style` setting (0-4)
- Bundled airports database significantly expanded (45,000+ entries) with richer metadata (name, municipality, country)
- Airport lookup now returns full airport info dict instead of just the name string, for both FR24 and tar1090 data sources

## [v2.0.5] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Updater no longer blocked by untracked files (e.g. `.bak` files from config migration) - `git status` now uses `--untracked-files=no`

## [v2.0.4] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Advanced flight zone mode: draw a bounding box on a map to define the search area instead of using a centre + radius
- Observer position setting (advanced mode) for weather, sunrise/sunset, satellite passes, and flight distance sorting
- Interactive map selector in the web UI for choosing between simple and advanced zone definitions

### Changed
- `flight_location_mode` config key added (`"simple"` or `"advanced"`)
- Web settings page reworked with map-based zone picker

## [v2.0.3] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Satellite pass timeout: optionally limit how long the satellite scene is shown per pass, yielding back to flight tracking after a configurable number of seconds from acquisition of signal (AOS)
- `satellite_timeout_enabled` and `satellite_timeout_seconds` config keys
- Satellite timeout controls in the web UI

### Fixed
- Restored polling route for web UI status updates

## [v2.0.2] - 2026-07-09
